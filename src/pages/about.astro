	<h2>💝 About My AMAZING Daughter</h2>

	<h2>🩺 About My Work</h2>
	<p>
		When I'm not spending time with my amazing daughter, I work as a neonatologist. That means I take care of tiny newborn babies who need extra help when they're born. It's an incredible job because I get to help families during one of the most important times in their lives!
	</p>

	<h2>💻 My Other Passion: Coding!</h2>
	<p>
		I also love writing code and building software! I believe technology can make healthcare better, and I enjoy creating tools that help doctors take better care of their patients. Plus, it's super fun to build things with code - almost as fun as building LEGO sets with my daughter!
	</p>

	<h2>🎯 My Mission</h2>
	<p>
		I want to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Help tiny babies grow strong and healthy 👶</li>
		<li>Use technology to improve healthcare 🏥</li>
		<li>Be the best dad I can be (though my daughter makes this easy!) 💝</li>
		<li>Learn new things every day 📖</li>
		<li>Make the world a better place, one small step at a time 🌍</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>🌟 The Best Part of My Life</h2>
	<p>
		Being a doctor is rewarding. Writing code is exciting. But being my daughter's dad? That's the BEST job in the entire universe! Every day she teaches me something new, makes me laugh, and reminds me of what's really important in life.
